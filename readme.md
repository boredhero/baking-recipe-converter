### About

I doubt this will be of any use to anyone. My father was a chef/baker, and I have a collection of recipes from him. Most of these call for extremely large amounts of ingredients. I.E., 50-75lbs flour. I use this to resize recipes while maintaining ingredient ratios. It's a simple commandline only program that imports a specifically formatted CSV and exports a results CSV.
